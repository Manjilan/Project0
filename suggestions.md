- consider adding a `.gitignore` to your root directory and adding `.DS_Store` to line 1 to ignore `.DS_Store` files from your github add list.

- Great html! Your codebase uses semantic html and I can completely see your site based on reading your code!

- Your whole site has a great sheen and polish to it. It feels quite professional.  I love the smooth transitions and all the small details you covered.

- Great work on your marvel api work! Very impressive!

- Your CSS is very well organized and written. No suggestions!

- Looking forward to your responsive layout!

- Consider moving your transition and smoothing effects into a separate file to take up less room in your `main.js`
